Hack Day Hack with lotsa hackiness 

An initial attempt at a bot to curate content during election season. Only handles basic queries and supports a handful of user cases. Hopefully to be expanded upon soon with smarter algorithms and a better try at NPL

For funsies, try:

- "who's the prettiest?"
- "is Obama winning?"
- "who is winning in my ..."
- "who is [firstName] [lastName]?" (of congressional candidate)


// Cecilia Reyes

To host locally, on a Mac, run from your terminal:

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port number]

Then navigate to localhost:[port number] in your browser
