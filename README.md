Hack Day Hack with lotsa hackiness 

An initial attempt at a bot to curate content during election season. Only handles basic queries and supports a handful of user cases. Hopefully to be expanded upon soon with smarter algorithms and a better try at NPL

For funsies, try:

"who's the prettiest?"
"is Obama winning?"
"who is winning in my ..."
"who is [firstName] [lastName]?" (of congressional candidate)
